# South-Asian-GDP-predictor
The project aimed to forecast GDP growth in the coming years using historical data on R&amp;D spending, trade, and other macroeconomic variables. Three models — Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression — were implemented to compare growth pattern predictions and to address issues of overfitting and underfitting in the dataset.
